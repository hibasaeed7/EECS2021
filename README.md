# EECS2021 - Computer Organization

This repository contains my lab work and assignments for **EECS2021: Computer Organization** at York University (Winter 2024). The course explores the fundamentals of computer architecture, bridging the gap between hardware and software, with hands-on experience in **RISC-V assembly** and **Verilog hardware design**.

## ðŸ“š Course Description

EECS2021 introduces the inner workings of computersâ€”from logic gates to CPU architecture. Students gain insight into how high-level code is translated into machine code and how computers process and store information. Key tools include:
- **RISC-V Assembly** for low-level software development
- **Verilog HDL** for hardware circuit design and simulation

By the end of the course:
- Translate high-level code into RISC-V assembly and machine code
- Represent data and understand its manipulation in a CPU
- Design and synthesize digital circuits, from logic gates to simple CPUs
- Analyze and compare performance across architectures
- Understand I/O and parallel hardware structures

## ðŸ§  Key Topics Covered

- Binary and hexadecimal systems
- Logic gates and combinational circuits
- Memory and datapath design
- Control units and CPU implementation
- RISC-V assembly programming
- Verilog hardware design (combinational and sequential logic)
- Performance metrics and CPU evaluation
- I/O and parallel hardware concepts
